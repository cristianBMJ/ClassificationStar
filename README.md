[Stars Categorization:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProyectsDataScience/blob/main/classification-star.ipynb)   Proyect classification's Machine Learning of Start Giants  or  Dwarfs , consider the  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesmsuic/star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs), SThe categorization the Stars was studied according to criteria the Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) classification system. Firstly, the dataset was cleaned  and then it was balanced. In order to apply  three models's Machine Learning, being *Random Forest Classification*   the one with the better results, obtaining a precision of 93%.
