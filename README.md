# Proyects of Data Science


[Stars Categorization:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProyectsDataScience/blob/main/classification-star.ipynb)   Proyect classification's Machine Learning of Start Giants  or  Dwarfs , consider the  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesmsuic/star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs). The categorization the Stars was studied according to criteria the Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) classification system. Firstly, the dataset was cleaned  and then it was balanced. In order to apply  three models's Machine Learning, being **Random Forest Classification**   the one with the better results, obtaining a precision of 93%.  


[Forecasting Store Sales:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/forecasting-store-sales.ipynb) Forecasting to determine Store Sales of Ecuador. The Stores are in locations in the country. The Model learning is the kind Hydrid, it be first model RandomForestRegressor while the second model is LinearRegression.
